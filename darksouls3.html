    <p>The fourth entry in the Souls series, Dark Souls III was released in Japan in March 2016, and worldwide in April 2016.
Dark Souls III was critically and commercially successful, with critics calling it a worthy and fitting conclusion to the series. It was the fastest-selling game in Bandai Namco's history, selling over three million copies worldwide within the first two months after release. 
Dark Souls III: The Fire Fades, a complete version containing the base game and both downloadable content expansions, was released in April 2017.
</p> 
<p>The game takes place in the land of Lothric and just like the other games your job is to defeat the evil as a cursed undead.</p>
