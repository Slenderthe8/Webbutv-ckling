    <h1>How Dark Souls Work</h1>
    <p>So the basics of dark souls, to be honest it has surprisingly easy mechanics. You’ve got a healing item that is called Estus Flask, to get more of them you need to find estus shards, and to upgrade them you need to find some kind of bone shards. There is a lot of different enemies, for example undeads, dragons, skeletons, different kind of animal looking stuff etc. But most of them aren’t even a big of a threat. The real obstacles is the bosses, most of the bosses can take a lot of tries to beat while some bosses almost dies instantly. There is one boss that has followed the players all the way to dark souls 3, and that boss is gravity. Like come on you just can’t beat it, if you fall of some height or fall of the map you’re dead and that’s that.
    </p>
    <p>When you kill monsters they give you souls and sometimes drop items. You can use the souls for a couple of stuff, but it’s mainly used for leveling up. The more you level up, the more souls you need. You can also buy items with the souls you get. The amount of souls you get depends on how tough the enemy is.</p>
    <p>Dark Souls has a unique checkpoint system. You use a bonfire as a resting area. When you rest you replenish your estus, you can also use the bonfire as a fast travel station. Bonfires are scattered all around the three awesome games so you’ve gotta keep your eyes open for them.</p>
    <p>There are a lot of items, when i say items i mean proximately up to almost 300 items each game. There are items such as weapons, shield, armor, consumables and scrolls. There are a lot of different weapon types such as daggers, short swords, long swords, greatswords, maces, axes etc. The same goes for shield and armor, there is light armor/shields and heavy armor/shields. There is that many consumables that i don’t even remember all of them even though i have over 400 hours on each game. Scrolls is basically your magic, there are 4 different elemental magic. There is the basic magic which is usually blue and sometimes white, it’s called sorcery. There is miracles which is holy magic, hexes which is dark magic and pyromancy which is fire magic but for some reason on dark souls 3 you can spit a boulder at enemies with pyromancy.</p>
    <p>The way you level up is different on each game, the reason it’s different is because there is different attribute points you can get on each game. There are attribute points such as Vitality, endurance, vigor, attunement, strength, dexterity, faith and intelligence. There is also luck but that’s in dark souls 3 and it’s useless.</p>
