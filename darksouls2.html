<p>Although both are set in the same universe, there is no direct story connection between the first Dark Souls and the sequel. The game uses dedicated multiplayer servers. Taking place in the world of Drangleic, the game features both player versus environment(PvE) and player versus player (PvP) gameplay, in addition to having some co-op components. As in the earlier games in the series, it again features challenging gameplay, but with a more powerful graphics engine and more advanced artificial intelligence system.</p>

<p> After some initial delays, the game was released worldwide in March 2014, with the Microsoft Windows version being released on April 24, 2014. An updated version of the game, Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin, was released in April 2015. The title is a compilation of the original game and its downloadable content, and also encompasses a remastered port of the game for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows with upgraded graphics, expanded online multiplayer capacity, and other various changes.
